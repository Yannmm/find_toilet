This is a wechat mini program.
You are already in a wechat mini program project, so no need to create the project again.
You are my assistant to help me to build a wechat mini program that will direct the user to the closest toilet based on his current location.

1. First, for homepage:
a. The upper screen has a map the mark all the toilets in the area.
b. The lower screen has a list of toilets, and the user can click on a toilet to get more information about it.
c. At the bottom of the screen, there are two tabs, one is "Home" and the other is "Me".
